            <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
                was born on October 15, 1931, in
                Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.
            </p>
            <p>
                He served as the 11th President
                of India from 2002 to 2007.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kalam earned a degree in
                aeronautical engineering from the
                Madras Institute of Technology and in
                1958 joined the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO).
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1969, he moved to the Indian
                Space Research Organisation, where he
                was project director of the SLV-III, the
                first satellite launch vehicle that was
                both designed and produced in India.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                Kalam planned the program that produced
                a number of successful missiles, which
                helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                “Missile Man.”</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Among those successes
                was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                ballistic missile, which incorporated
                aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                in 1989.
            </p>
            <p>
                He also played a
                pivotal organisational, technical,
                and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
                the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
            </p>
            <p>
                From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
                was scientific adviser to the defense
                minister, and he later served as principal
                scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
                government with the rank of cabinet minister.
            </p>
            <p>
                His prominent role in
                the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                solidified India as a nuclear power and
                established Kalam as a national hero,
                although the tests caused great concern
                in the international community.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1998 Kalam put
                forward a countrywide plan called
                Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                as a road map for transforming India from
                a less-developed to a developed society
                in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                other measures, increasing agricultural
                productivity, emphasizing technology as
                a vehicle for economic growth, and
                widening access to health care and
                education.
